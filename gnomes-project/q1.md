Identify gnomes in black hats and gnomes in white hats

Write a function get_colors_straightforward(evidences) that takes a list ‘evidences’ and returns a tuple with

    (1) a sorted list of gnomes (IDs) in white hats, and (2) a sorted list of gnomes (IDs) in black hats IF no contradiction was found in each single evidence,
    None IF a contradiction was found.

Assume that all gnome pairs in the input 'evidences' list wear same color hats, i.e. ((11, 2), 1) is not valid because gnomes 11 and 2 have different hat colors.

def get_colors_straightforward(evidences)

    Input: a list of tuples
    Returns: a tuple of two sorted lists OR None if a contradiction was found

>>> evidences = [((11, 2), 0), ((3, 6), 2), ((7, 9), 2)]

>>> print(get_colors_straightforward(evidences))

([3, 6, 7, 9], [2, 11])

If we now change ((3, 6), 2) to ((3, 2), 2), it will contradict ((11, 2), 0), and the function returns None:

>>> evidences = [((11, 2), 0), ((3, 2), 2), ((7, 9), 2)]

>>> print(get_colors_straightforward(evidences))

None
